<h2>Welcome to the how to join a shapefile with a csv tutorial!</h2>

The join_csv_with_shapefile.R file will easily convert your files, no questions asked. 

If you'd like to learn about how it works, open the
join_shp_with_csv.md (not join_shp_with_csv.Rmd) file to get a tutorial with code examples.

###Here is a list of the files/folders:

join_csv_with_shapefile.R -> (hopefully) easy to use  annotated script for converting your files

Constit -> folder containing example shapefiles

ukip_candidate_seats.csv -> example .csv

join_shp_with_csv.md -> tutorial identical to join_shp_with_csv.Rmd, 
                        but which renders in Github,
                        allowing the inclusion of code examples

join_shp_with_csv.Rmd -> see above ^^

Any questions email me billy.ehrenberg@ft.com

Happy coding!
