This is a readMe doc for the using checkpoint tutorial. When you write a script, you should add a file like this with the date you wrote the code so others can use checkpoint to load the required R packages in the version they existed at the time you wrote the code.

The date I wrote this tutorial was "2017-07-10"

enjoy!

Here are some useful links for getting to know Checkpoint, and they're more comprehensive than this quick guide I've thrown together.
